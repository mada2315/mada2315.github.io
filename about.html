        <div class="third"><p>When I was younger, I was always finding new ways to express my creativity. Whether through drawing, writing, or taking videos of my little siblings, I have always been a story-teller at heart. Through working my first job as a server at Erickson Living in high school, I realized that I had a deep passion for making relationships and being the tie between a company and a consumer.</p></div>
        <div class="fourth"><p>Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder on track to receive a Bachelor of Science in Strategic Communications with an emphasis in Public Relations and a double minor in Creative Technology & Design and Sports Media. As I continue to excel in both my schoolwork and my internships, I am eager to learn more about the PR industry and figure out what amazing stories I have to tell.</p></div>
        <div class="fifth"><p>Since starting college, I've developed a deep passion for the sports industry and the stories that are told through teams to create a loyal fanbase. Although I would have thought you were crazy if you told me about my current career goals when I was younger, I now spend most nights watching anything from professional hockey to college football and basketball. As my love for sports grows, my goal is to one day work in the PR sports industry and be a part of the behind-the-scenes that make the fan experience so amazing.</p></div>
