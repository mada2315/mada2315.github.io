        <div class="pick2"><h1>A Day in the Life with the Colorado Rapids</h1></div>
        <div class="pick3"><p>The Colorado Rapids are the professional soccer team in Colorado through the MLS. I started working there in the summer of 2022 as a marketing intern, working directly under the Director of Marketing. This experience was one that I will forever be grateful for. Each day I would come to work and feel like I was genuinely needed rather than one of those traditional interns that you see on TV who gets coffee and orders office supplies.</p></div>
        <div class="pick4"><p>When I started this position, I was a little bit of a special case scenario because of the fact that the Rapids were understaffed. Although my boss at the time typically had two people working under him full time, I was the only one. Because of this, a lot of the tasks that I was assigned were more of a Coordinator’s role instead of an intern. When I got to the stadium each day, I would start by going through a lot of emails. Because my job was to coordinate between departments to get specific elements needed for certain weekly projects, I would get a lot of emails with elements needed to conduct my daily work. Then, I would take this elements and compile them to send out Gameday Guides, weekly newsletters, TV and Radio broadcast scripts, and paid media copy.</p></div>
        <div class="pick5"><p>On a typical came day, I would get to the stadium 3ish hours before kickoff. Because my boss typically worked on the field, I was able to help out more on the media side of things with the director of public relations. I checked in a lot of media from local and national news outlets as well as photographers. I would give them each a credential that stated where they were allowed to go and a vest if they were allowed to go on the field. After all of the media was checked in, I would typically go to the field where I would stand and monitor the photographers to make sure they didn’t go anywhere they weren’t supposed to, as well as watch the game!</p></div>
