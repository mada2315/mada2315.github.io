        <div class="pick3"><p>Over the course of my most recent internship, I was lucky enough to interact with the Stanley Cup multiple times. I was able to join along on multiple appearances including one with UCHealth and one at Breckenridge Brewery. I was also able to see the raising of the cup at the 2022-23 Avalanche Opening Night where the Stanley Cup Banner was unveiled at Ball Arena.</p></div>
        <div class="pick4"><p>The UCHealth appearance was located at the Anschutz campus. Adam Foote, a previous cup winner when the team won in 2001, surprised two heart transplant patients with a private viewing of the Stanley Cup where he was able to lift the cup so that they could drink out of it. Afterward, we carted the Stanley Cup around to where patients in the burn center were able to touch it alongside nurses and staff. The picture to the right is one that was taken at the staff viewing at Anschutz after we visited patients. The Breckenridge Brewery appearance was a little bit different as it was one that was open to the general public. Our staff gathered there for a happy hour and I was able to invite my sister who lived about 15 minutes away. She was more excited to meet Bernie than see the Stanley Cup thoughâ€¦</p></div>
        <div class="pick5"><p>Opening Night was perhaps the best night of them all because I was able to give one special fan a memory of a lifetime. She was a member of the United States Military and was being recognized as the Navy Federal Credit Union Military Member of the Game. In this sense, she was recognized on the ice during the singing of the national anthem. She was so excited to be there and beyond surprised when she saw the cup before her recognition. During the banner raising ceremony, there were tears streaming down her face as she took in the amazing fans around her. After her recognition, the Keepers of the Cup took the Stanley Cup out of its case just for her so that she could take a picture with it and kiss it. These are the kind of moments that make me certain I want to stay in the Sports Industry.</p></div>
