        <div class="pick3"><p>As much as I hated how everyone I met in college would tell me how networking was so important, they were completely right. Networking is EVERYTHING in this industry!! Everyone always asks me how I was able to get a position within professional sports at such a young age. My best answer will always be networking. When I first discovered that sports marketing was where I wanted to spend my career, I began by reaching out personally to every person within the industry that had a position that I may eventually be interested in pursuing through LinkedIn.</p></div>
        <div class="pick4"><p>Once I found a person, I would request to connect and private message them something like: “Hi (name)! My name is Cassidy and I am currently studying at the University of Colorado. My goal is to one day have a position like yours. Do you have any advice for what I should be doing now to achieve that goal?” You won’t believe just how many people will be willing to help and even jump on a Zoom or meet for a coffee. The VP of Basketball Operations for the Denver Nuggets once told me that “We (current professionals) are laying the groundwork for us (college students) to continue their legacy.” </p></div>
