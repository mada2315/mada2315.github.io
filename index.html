    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Cassidy Davis</strong> (she/her). My goals for this course include getting more comfortable with coding and learning how to create my own website. I'm a Strategic Communications major with an emphasis in Public Relations and a double minor in Creative Technology & Design and Sports Media. In my free time, I love watching sports, hanging out with friends, listening to music, and going to concerts.</p>
